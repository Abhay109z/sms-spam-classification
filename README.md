- Clean and preprocess SMS text data

- Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF

- Train and evaluate classification models

- Visualize performance metrics

- Streamlit interface for interactive use

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- scikit-learn

- NLTK

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Streamlit 

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Abhay109z/sms-spam-classification.git
cd sms-spam-classification

- Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

- Run the Streamlit app

streamlit run streamlit_app.py

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is SMSSpamCollection, which contains labeled SMS messages. It is loaded and processed within the notebook.

## 📊 Model
The project uses a Naive Bayes classifier and evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
